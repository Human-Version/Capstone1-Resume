        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p> A lifetime learner, Arief Fajar is an Electrical Engineering student who thrives beyond his academic background with a highly motivated and determined person in technology. I am an active member of numerous organizational committees and took courses and training to improve his soft skills. <br/>
            My specialities include quickly learning new skills and programming language, problem solving, social media design. So far I have HTML, CSS, Python, Java, C, and Git/GitHub under my belt.
